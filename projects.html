                        <p>This application recognizes and labels a variety of objects but its main objective is to identify and locate cars. This was a project that was used to help Toyota streamline their vehicle production by allowing AI to manage their processes with more precision. The app uses a model which has been trained using a comprehensive sample pool. Click image above to see source code.</p>

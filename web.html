                        <h3>Python</h3>
                        <p>Using Python I have constructed functions with varying complexity, created a few sorting algorithms, manipulated and altered data sets, created an object detection program using computer vision concepts, and a game which is a platform jumper. The python libraries I have utilized are PyGame, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, and Matlab</p>
